                <h3>FUN WAYS TO WELCOME 2021:<br>
                  THE QUARANTINE EDITION</h3>
                <p style="display: inline-block;">
                  <img src="images/ny.jpg" width="100%" height="400px" style="border-radius: 10px;">
                  <br>
                  This year deserved a big fat goodbye, owing to all the menace it caused.
                  But 2020 doesn’t seem to be a great fan of parties – so what now? Well,
                  let’s hit the couch and throw an unforgettable party at home and bring in a
                  brand New Year. <br>
                  2020 was pretty much like the Monday blues that faded away as soon as it crept in. Honestly, deep down we all are going to miss the year that everyone wants to forget.
                  The late night sessions of dalgona coffee, the hysterical laughter after defeating your friends in a game of ludo, or the monotonous ‘Am I audible’ meetings made the year a memorable one.
                  The pandemic definitely turned out to be harsh on all of us in different possible ways, but it also reminded us of the beautiful things in life that we sometimes leave behind, starting from spending time with our families and our own
                  self.

                  And now it is time to bid goodbye to this rollercoaster of a year i.e. 2020. Even though the past year has been challenging for us, one should not go overboard with the New Year celebrations this year.
                  Hence, we have some freshly-baked ideas to spice up your celebration of the year:-

                </p><br>

                <h3>1. DRESS UP FOR A NIGHT IN </h3>
                <p style="display: inline-block;">
                  <img src="images/dressup.jpg" width="100%" height="400px" style="border-radius: 15px;">
                  <br>
                  The fact that you are home for New Year’s Eve should not stop you from adding
                  a little glam to your house party. Get dolled up and dress up the way you like.
                  Buy an outfit of your choice, set your hair, put on your favourite pair of
                  footwear and you’re ready to bring in the New Year.
                </p>

                <h3>2. MOVIE MARATHON </h3>
                <p style="display: inline-block;">
                  <img src="images/movie.jpg" width="100%" height="400px" style="border-radius: 15px;">
                  <br>
                  Just sit back with a bucket of popcorn and binge watch all your favourite
                  movies and series. You can always go for a clichéd holiday or chick- flick movie.
                  No one’s judging!
                </p>

                <h3>3. MAKE YOURSELF A LAVISH MEAL/ORDER FOOD </h3>
                <p style="display: inline-block;">
                  <img src="images/food.jpg" width="100%" height="400px" style="border-radius: 15px;">
                  <br>
                  Treat yourself for avoiding the crowds and tempting parties, by cooking a
                  lavish dinner for you and your family. If you’re not a fan of culinary you
                  can always order food from your favourite restaurant or go for a pizza.
                </p>

                <h3>4. HAVE A SMALL FAMILY GET TOGETHER</h3>
                <p style="display: inline-block;">
                  <img src="images/family.jpg" width="100%" height="400px" style="border-radius: 15px;">
                  <br>
                  Jog down memory lane by simply spending time with your family and gift them a perfect holiday gift. And what better than personalized photo frames or family collages. You can choose trendy gifts for your loved ones from Wood Greek's
                  collection of customized photo frames and photo collages.
                  Visit us : <a href="https://www.woodgreek.com/">woodgreek</a>
                </p>

                <h3>5. SLEEP IN</h3>
                <p style="display: inline-block;">
                  <img src="images/sleep.jpg" width="100%" height="400px" style="border-radius: 15px;">
                  <br>
                  If you’re not a fan of parties and celebrations you can always snuggle
                  inside your cozy blanket and sleep on New Year’s Eve.
                </p>

                <h3>6. PLAN A VACATION FOR THE NEXT YEAR</h3>
                <p style="display: inline-block;">
                  <img src="images/plan.jpg" width="100%" height="400px" style="border-radius: 15px;">
                  <br>
                  Look forward towards the upcoming year and start making your travel plans
                  which were disrupted by this year. The last day of the year is indeed the
                  best time to make plans for the next year.
                </p>

                <h3>7. WATCH THE BALL DROP </h3>
                <p style="display: inline-block;">
                  <img src="images/balldrop.jpg" width="100%" height="400px" style="border-radius: 15px;">
                  <br>
                  On 31 December every year, a giant, glowing ball is lowered down from the top
                  of the Times Square building in New York City at 11.59pm.
                  Due to the pandemic it can be witnessed virtually via streaming on
                  <a href="https://timessquareball.net/">TimesSquareBall</a> and <a href="https://www.timessquarenyc.org/">TimesSquareNYC</a> starting at 6 p.m.
                </p>

                <h3>8. END IT WITH A RESOLUTION</h3>
                <p style="display: inline-block;">
                  <img src="images/resolution.jpg" width="100%" height="400px" style="border-radius: 15px;">
                  <br>
                  No New Year party is complete without our firm and dedicated resolutions for the next year, which might not last that long. So don’t forget to make a resolution before the clock strucks 12 and try to complete it for as long as you can!
                  I hope these ideas help you bring in a fun and memorable time! <br><br>
